# Webcam Fun

##### What does it do?
On this page we can take photos and save them. We can add filters in the photo preview.

##### How does the website work?
I used HTML, CSS, JavaScript to make the page. The website uses a camera from user device. The image from the device is constantly being changed.

##### Where did I get the idea for this website?
The beginning of the project was made during the "30-day JavaScript Challenge", but I expanded the project by making sliders with the possibility of changing the filter intensity. I also added possibility to remove all filters from the photo.
